# Penance View Improved

Here we go again, this time bringing improvements to the Penance view!

Main features:

    List of "Recently Completed" penances
    Expand sub-penance tasks to display description, progress, and even child penances.
    Inspect all rewards (Including an all new inspect screen for trinkets, insignias and portraits)


Designed to work alongside the fantastic mod Archivum Messelinaï»¿ by Wobin.

Pairs well with Commodore's Vestures Improved for extra functionality.

Install Penances Improved and Archivum Messelina to have the best penance experience possible.
